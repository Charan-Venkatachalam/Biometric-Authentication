# Biometric-Authentication
Implementing facial and fingerprint recognition biometric authentication involves 
using specialized libraries and APIs. The code provides you with a basic example 
for each using Python. Note that you'll need to install certain libraries, and for 
fingerprint recognition, you might need specific hardware.


FACE RECOGNITION(faceRecog.py)
Replace "person.jpg" and "unknown.jpg" with the paths to your images.


FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION(fingRecog.py)
For fingerprint recognition, you might need a fingerprint sensor.
Make sure to replace '/dev/ttyUSB0' with the correct serial port for your 
fingerprint sensor.
